# 🌐 Hosting a Static Website on AWS EC2

This is my first mini project where I learned to host a static website using an **AWS EC2 instance** and **Apache web server**. The project walks through launching an EC2 instance, connecting via SSH, setting up a web server, deploying a static HTML page, and accessing it through the public IP.
